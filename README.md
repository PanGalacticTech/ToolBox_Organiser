# ToolBox_Organiser
 STL and .ipt files for Peli Style Toolcase Organiser

I have been trying to find a cheap but smart solution for organising my tools in my Peli Style toolcase.

I found a few off the shelf versions, I particularly liked this product from trekpak: [TrekPak](https://www.waterproof-cases.co.uk/product/trekpak-1510-for-peli-1510-case)

However the cost was extremly offputting given the materials. I wanted something clean and configurable but cheaper. Preferably with materials I already had to hand.


## My Solution: 3D Printed ToolCase Inserts

The inserts are made up of a total of 6 different parts. The minimum parts to make the inserts are:

| Quantity | Part        | Colour       |
|---       |---          |---           |
|   4 x    | Part A      | Light Blue   |
|   2 x    | Part B      | Dark Blue    |
|   2 x    | Part C      | Green        |
|   2 x    | Part D      | Purple       |
|  10      | Parts Total |              |

Part B is glued between 2 x part A to make up one of the horizontal dividers. <br>

Part C and Part D are glued together to make up one vertical dividers. <br>

Additional horizontal and vertical dividors can be printed as required, along with the 2 shorter single and double row dividors - shown in pink.

This was done to make sure the parts could be printed on smaller printers. I dont think any part is larger than 150mmx150mm  <br>

## Print Settings

I am using an AnyCubic S3, and I have chosen to print each part standing up. With my current print settings in cura:

Layer Height - 0.2 mm
Print Speed  - 50mm/s
Infill       - 18.0%
Infill Pattern - Gyroid
Build Plate - Brim
Brim Width - 8.0 mm

The average parts are coming out as just under 5 hours of print time, and uses approximatly 50g of PLA.

## Costing and Materials

Using the settings above, I would expect the minimum frame to use just over 500g of material, therefore it will use about half a roll of PLA, and cost me about Â£12.50
in raw material costs. Even with an additional long divider and a couple of the shorter dividers, the whole lots shouldnt cost more than a single reel of PLA, making it much cheaper than the off the shelf alternative I found earlier.
