# ToolBox_Organiser
 STL and .ipt files for Peli Style Toolcase Organiser

I have been trying to find a cheap but smart solution for organising my tools in my Peli Style toolcase.

I found a few off the shelf versions, I particularly liked this product from [TrekPak](https://www.waterproof-cases.co.uk/product/trekpak-1510-for-peli-1510-case).

However the cost was extremly offputting given the materials they used. I wanted something clean and configurable but cheaper. Preferably with materials I already had to hand.


## My Solution: 3D Printed ToolCase Inserts

The inserts are made up of a total of 6 different parts. The minimum parts to make the inserts are:

| Quantity | Part        | Colour       |
|---       |---          |---           |
|   4 x    | Part A      | Light Blue   |
|   2 x    | Part B      | Dark Blue    |
|   2 x    | Part C      | Green        |
|   2 x    | Part D      | Purple       |
|  10      | Parts Total |              |

Part B is glued between 2 x part A to make up one of the horizontal dividers. <br>

Part C and Part D are glued together to make up one vertical dividers. <br>

Additional horizontal and vertical dividors can be printed as required. <br>

Part E and F (Pink) are shorter row dividers and can be printed as required to splitting up rows into shorter sections.

This was done to make sure the parts could be printed on smaller printers. I dont think any part is larger than 150mmx150mm  <br>

All parts are 7mm wide, and so far seem strong enough to work for this purpose.

## Print Settings

I am using an AnyCubic S3, and I have chosen to print each part standing up. With my current print settings in cura:
| Setting | Value |
|---      |---    |
|Layer Height | 0.2 mm |
|Print Speed  | 50mm/s |
|Infill       | 18.0% |
|Infill Pattern | Gyroid |
|Build Plate | Brim |
|Brim Width | 8.0 mm |

The average parts are coming out as just under 5 hours of print time, and uses approximatly 50g of PLA.

Total print time for my use will be ~ 65 hours!

## Costing and Materials

Using the settings above, I would expect the minimum frame to use just over 500g of material, therefore it will use about half a roll of PLA, and cost me about Â£12.50
in raw material costs. Even with an additional long divider and a couple of the shorter dividers, the whole lots shouldnt cost more than a single reel of PLA, making it much cheaper than the off the shelf alternative I found earlier.
